; You can specify which exact side to hide using the sideToHide setting.
; Everyone and everything also become invulnerable to all attacks

; Takes a screenshot and saves it at screenshotPath path
; To take screenshots over a transparent background you need to go to the game's
; Display Settings and turn off Post-Effects (or use turnOffPostEffectWhenMakingBackgroundBlack
; or togglePostEffectOnOff for this), then use blackBackgroundToggle.
; Then screenshots will film character over transparent background
; If the dontUseScreenshotTransparency setting is true, screenshot will be without
; transparency anyway

; setting "screenshotPath" specifies where screenshots will be saved.
; If you provided a file path it must be with extension, and if such name already exists a
; number will be appended to it, increasing from 1 to infinity consecutively so that it's unique.
; If you provided a directory path, it must already exist, and "screen.png" will be appended to
; it with an increasing number at the end in case the filename is not unique.
; The provided path must be without quotes.
; If you want the path to be multilingual you need to save this file in UTF-8.
; On Ubuntu/Linux running Guilty Gear Xrd under Steam Proton you need to specify paths with
; the Z:\ drive, path separator is backslash (\), not forward slash (/). Example: Z:\home\yourUserName\ggscreen.png
; If the path is not specified or is empty, the screenshot will be saved into your clipboard so
; it can be pasted into any image editing program. For example, GIMP will recognize the PNG
; format and paste that, with transparency. This would work even on Ubuntu/Linux.
; Only PNG format is supported.

; When this is true that means screenshots are being taken every game loop logical frame as
; long as the screenshotBtn is being held. Game loop logical frame means that if the game is
; paused or the actual animations are not playing for whatever reason, screenshot won't be taken.
; A new screenshot is only taken when animation frames change on the player characters.
; Be cautions not to run out of disk space if you're low. This option doesn't
; work if screenshotPath is empty, it's not allowed to work outside of training or replay mode or when
; a match (training session) isn't currently running (for example on character selection screen).
